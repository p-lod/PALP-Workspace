# PALP Workspace

PALP Workspace is a Flask web application that was created to help researchers for the PALP project connect different sources of data to each other and describe images. It links  [Pompei: pitture e mosaici](https://www.worldcat.org/title/pompei-pitture-e-mosaici/oclc/28254535),  [Pitture e pavimenti di Pompei](https://www.worldcat.org/title/pitture-e-pavimenti-di-pompei/oclc/490575255),  [PompeiiinPictures](https://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/index.htm), and [an ArcGIS Map](https://arcg.is/ivHP0). The workspace is currently hosted at [https://workspace.p-lod.umasscreate.net/](https://workspace.p-lod.umasscreate.net/).

## User Workflow

Users start by entering location, and can then choose from the ARCs at that location. Each successive tab walks them through steps like validating OCR data, copying relevant descriptions, and verifying relevant pictures chosen in the [Prequel](https://prequel.p-lod.umasscreate.net/). The Description tab is where that all comes together to save this linked data and use it to populate a Google Sheet with more detailed information.
